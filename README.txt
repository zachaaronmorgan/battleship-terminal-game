Hello and welcome to my Battleship Terminal Game

The point of this project is to practice python, git and github, and other core concepts learned. I intend for this to be a fun little game for people to play if they're bored. This game is meant to be a two player game. As of right now both players need to be human in order to play. 

Game Initialization

The game runs on Python 3.11.9 and numpy version 1.26.4

to start the game run the file titled GameInitialize.py


Then input player 1 and 2 names respectively. The board is automatically generated for you when you create your player name. When the game asks for positions you need to give it positions like A1, C5, J10, etc when prompted. The positions need to be between letters A and J followed by a number between 1 and 10. If you enter an incorrect value don't worry. The program should catch it and ask you to reenter the value. 


This is my first python game. Please let me know what you think of it and if you have any notes or additional features you would like.
